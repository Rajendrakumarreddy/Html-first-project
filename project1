   <p><abbr title="Yeduguri Sandinti Jagan Mohan Reddy">YSJ</abbr> (born 21 December 1972), also known mononymously as Jagan, is an Indian politician and a <strong>Member of Legislative Assembly representing Pulivendula</strong>
     Assembly constituency in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative assembly. He previously served as the 17th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He is the president of YSR Congress Party. He is also the son of Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, 
     former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

     Jagan Mohan Reddy started his political career in the Indian National Congress and was elected as the Member of Parliament of Kadapa in 2009. After his father's death due to a helicopter crash in 2009, 
     he started an Odarpu Yatra (a consoling tour) 
     across the state. He then eventually came out of the Congress Party and established his own party, YSR Congress Party which also matches his father's acronym, YSR.On 27 May 2012, 
     Reddy was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on embezzlement charges.
      CBI summoned Reddy for allegedly 
     amassing huge assets through illegal means by using his father's office, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, when he was the chief minister. CBI and ED has also summoned 58 companies of investing in Reddy's businesses,
      for the favours they allegedly received in the form of mining leases, allotments of projects. 
     His judicial custody was extended repeatedly as the investigation proceeded. The Supreme Court of India dismissed his Bail petition on 4 July 2012, 9 August 2012, 7 November 2012,
      9 May 2013, 13 May 2013. After 16 months of punishment, he walked out of Jail on 24 September 2013.

    In the 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, YSRCP won 67 seats and he became the Leader of the Opposition. Five years later, in 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, 
    he led the party to a landslide victory in the state elections by <strong>winning 151 seats of the total 175 assembly segments.</strong>
     on 12 June 2024 after the TDP in alliance with the BJP and the JSP won the 2024 state legislative assembly election in a landslide, garnering 164 out of 175 seats and defeating the YSR Congress Party which stopped down to meagre 11 seats.</p>

     <h4>political carrer</h4>
     <p>Reddy's father <strong>Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy</strong>, popularly known as YSR, was a two-time chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, serving from 2004 to 2009. He started his political career campaigning for Indian National Congress during the 2004 elections in Kadapa district. 
        In 2009, he was elected as Member of Parliament from Kadapa Lok Sabha constituency.

      Following the death of his father in September 2009, he started efforts to take up the political legacy left by his father. The majority of the legislators favoured him to be appointed as the Chief Minister, 
      but this choice was not approved by party leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.

     Six months after his father's death, he began an odarpu yatra (condolence tour), as promised earlier, to go and meet the families of those alleged to have either committed suicide or suffered ill health on the news of his father's death. 
      The Congress party's central leadership directed him to call off his odarpu yatra, an order which he defied leading to a fallout between the high command and himself. He went ahead with the yatra, stating that it was a personal matter.</p>
